Returns the product of two values. If the left-hand-side is scalar (non collection) then a straightforward multiplication will take place. If the left-hand-side is a collection and it is multiplied by `n`, e.g. `{a=a+1} * 3` it will be added (`+`) to itself `n` times i.e. `{a=a+1} + {a=a+1} + {a=a+1}`.
