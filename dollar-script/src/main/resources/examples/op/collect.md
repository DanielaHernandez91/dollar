The `collect` operator listens for changes in the supplied expression adding all the values to a list until the `until` clause is triggered. It then evaluates the second expression with the values `it` for the current value, `count` for the number of messages **received** since last emission and `collected` for the collected values. The whole operator itself emits `void` unless the collection operation is triggered in which case it emits the collection itself. Values can be skipped with an `unless` clause. Skipped messages increase the count value, so use `#collected` if you want the number of collected values.
