The assertion opeartor is used to assert that an expression holds true. It is a reactive operator such that it is evaluated when the right-hand-side expression changes. so `.: a > 10` is asserting that a is **always** greater than 10. To avoid reactive behaviour use the fix operator such as `.: &a > 10` which means that when this statement is evaluated the value of a is compared with 10 - if __at this point__ it is not greater than 10 then the assertion will fail.
