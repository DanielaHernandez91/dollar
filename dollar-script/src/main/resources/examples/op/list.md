Dollar's lists are pretty similar to JavaScript arrays. They are defined using the `[1,2,3]` style syntax and accessed using the `x[y]` subscript syntax. You can count the size of the list using the size operator `#`. Dollar maps are also associative arrays (like JavaScript) allowing you to request members from them using the list subscript syntax `x[y]` or the member syntax `.`.
