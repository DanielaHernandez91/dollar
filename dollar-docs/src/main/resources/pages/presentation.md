#This is what Dollar looks like

```dollar
geo= read http://freegeoip.net/json/
.: geo is Map

lat= geo.latitude
lon= geo.longitude

month= (DATE()-30)['MONTH_OF_YEAR']
year= (DATE()-30)['YEAR_OF_ERA']
crimes= read (("http://data.police.uk/api/crimes-at-location?date=" + year + "-" + month + "&lat=" + lat + "&lng=" + lon) as Uri)
categories= crimes each { $1.category }
.: categories is List

if (~ categories["anti-social-behaviour"]) {
  @@ "Anti-Social behaviour in your area last month!"
} else {
  @@ "No anti-social behaviour in your area last month!"
}

"The End!"
```
